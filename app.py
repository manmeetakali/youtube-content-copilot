<p>Hey, I'm <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/manmeetakali/' target='_blank'>Manmeet</a>. I built this because most brands get YouTube wrong. üìâ</p>

<p>Brands usually go "me-me-me" & treat YT like an ad campaign. Big budgets. Zero Soul. The content ends up saying what <em>the brand</em> wants to say, not what <em>the user</em> actually cares about. That‚Äôs why it flops. ‚ùå</p>

<p>The secret of this tool? We don‚Äôt start with product features. We start with real-life problems your user faces ‚Äî and build content that solves, celebrates, or spotlights those problems. üí° The result: content that feels useful, shareable, and human. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

You are an idea strategist and creative storyteller. Your task is to deeply analyze the 50 consumer problems listed below and come up with 12 highly relatable and powerful YouTube video content ideas that either:
- solve these problems in a useful or inspirational way
- celebrate or poke fun at them if they can't be solved

Make sure the brand's role is subtle ‚Äî woven into the content like a friend offering help, not like a sales pitch. Prioritize making the viewer feel understood and seen.

Use the IUCTC lens (Inspirational, Useful, Celebratory, Topical, Change-the-world) to diversify the content tone. Limit to just the 12 strongest ideas. Each should be:

1. Deeply rooted in a real consumer insight
2. Emotionally engaging, surprising, or witty
3. Featuring the brand as an enabler, not the hero

Structure the output as a table with the following columns:
- Suggested Week (1 to 12) Arrange the ideas in ascending order of the week number
- Category (Inspirational, Useful, Celebratory, Topical, Change-the-world)
- Video Title (use best practices ‚Äî curiosity-piquing)
- Concept Summary (explain why this video solves a real problem and how the brand fits in & what's the hook) 
- Suggested Format (e.g., Vlog, Voxpop, podcast, Animation, etc.)

Business Summary: {biz_desc}
Personas: {personas}
Geography: {geo}
Brand Archetype: {archetype}
Problems:

Output the table above. Then suggest:
1. 5 bonus content ideas (short bullets, fun, high-virality potential)
2. A content repurposing plan for each video, especially recommending how to extract short-form clips (e.g., Reels, Shorts) from the main content ‚Äî especially for podcasts or interviews. Highlight how the brand can drive visibility through these clips.

Avoid repetition. Let the brand feel like a helpful enabler woven into the narrative, not the main character.. Make them fun, surprising, and high-virality potential. Avoid repetition.
